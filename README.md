###Sample Proposal heading

####Author

A simple Online application that can be searched with sinhala, sinlish or english and get there relevant meanings.

####Author


Pasindu De Silva


####Description


Some Sri Lankan data has been published in the following link [Sri Lanka Open Data](http://www.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=301&Itemid=423&lang=en). Currently there are in xls and pdf format.

As developers we can do more if it was in SQL and do some nice graphics. My suggestion is to take them from XLS or PDF and make SQL and later provide developers a API.

###4. local language font compatibility library for android


####Author


Pahan Sarathchandra


####Description


Android 5.0 lollipop was released recently with sinhala/tamil language. We can make 'noto sans sinhala' font compatible across all android versions. I have done similar work in kichibichiya, siyalu, hathmaluwa android apps. But need to rewrite to fix performance issues.
