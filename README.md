####Description


Some Sri Lankan data has been published in the following link [Sri Lanka Open Data](http://www.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=301&Itemid=423&lang=en). Currently there are in xls and pdf format.

As developers we can do more if it was in SQL and do some nice graphics. My suggestion is to take them from XLS or PDF and make SQL and later provide developers a API.
